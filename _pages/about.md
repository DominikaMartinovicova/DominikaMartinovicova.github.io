After attending the course of Cellular Biology I became interested in the cellular and molecular pathways occurring in the organism. I find it incredible how particles as small as RNA or proteins can affect the well-being of the whole organism. It is fascinating to learn about these fields of Biomedical Sciences as it provides us with explanations and insights into fundamental mechanisms affecting the whole organism. 

The topic of molecular and cell biology arose again when I was taking a course in Immunology which I found very intriguing mostly because of its complexity and potential that this field entails. I find the molecular processes of various immunological mechanisms very interesting and would love to learn more as I am planning to pursue this path in my future studies and hopefully research as well. 

In order to gain more insight into Immunology and Biomedical field in general I am taking part in the Honours Program and as a part of it I wrote a Star Variant extension of my Neurosciences course that discussed the potential of psychedelics to inhibit chronic inflammation via 5HT2A receptors and thereby counteract the inflammation induced by cytokines in multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, I collected information and compared different methods and commercial kits for urinary cell-free DNA isolation for a research group of Prof. Steenbergen in Amsterdam Cancer Center.

Throughout my studies I had the opportunity to gain basic lab skills during my courses - Immunology, Research in Biochemstry, Genetics, Medical Pharmacology and Biochemistry. Additionally, I can provide good critical thinking and scientific communication skills which I gained via multiple written and oral assignments. 

Besides my studies, I am working as an English teacher and a personal private tutor. As both of these activities require preparation and punctuality it has taught me a great deal of organization, reliability, and time management.Â
