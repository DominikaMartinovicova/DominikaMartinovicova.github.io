I'm a dedicated student with a diverse background in education and scientific research. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences from Vrije University Amsterdam, graduating with a GPA of 8.3 and earning an Honours diploma. My studies have equipped me with a solid foundation in various Biomedical Sciences disciplines, including Genetics, Cell Biology, Immunology, and Human Physiology.

Working as a Senior English teacher and a private tutor, specialising in teaching mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and English language. My expertise includes teaching English to diverse sectors, including public, corporate, and private, as well as preparing students for English language proficiency certificates.

Alongside my teaching commitments, I've gained hands-on experience through internships, notably at the Cancer Center Amsterdam. During this internship, I worked on identifying miRNAs involved in hyperthermia-induced radio-sensitivity of cervical cancer cell lines, conducting tasks such as cell cultures, transfection, RNA isolation, PCR, and colony formation assays.

Currently pursuing a Masters in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, I'm expanding my knowledge in cutting-edge fields like Scientific Machine Learning and Bioinformatics for Translational Medicine. Building up on my Bachelor’s courses of statistical analyses in SPSS and computationally-based research assignments in MatLab, I’ve broadened my skill set with R, Python as well as Wolfram Mathematica.

Last but not least, both my study and job experience has trained my communication skills in written as well as spoken format to various audiences. Fluent in multiple languages including Slovak, English, Czech, and with elementary proficiency in Dutch, I'm able to engage effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
