**Cancer Center Amsterdam**\
-> Feb 2023 - Jun 2023\
I have worked as an intern for 4 months in Cancer Center Amsterdam on a research identifying miRNAs involved in hyperthermia-induced radio-sensitivity of SiHa cervical cancer cell line. I validated the sensitizing properties of miR-221-3p using colony formation assay and subsequently predicted its mRNA targets by analysing data from in-house and publicly available databases. Finally, I verified these targets by isolating the RNA from miR-221-3p-transfected SiHa cells.
